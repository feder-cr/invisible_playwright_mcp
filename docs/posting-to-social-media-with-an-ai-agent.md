# Posting to social media with an AI agent

You wrote something and you want it on your own social accounts without opening
five tabs and pasting five times. Three genuinely different routes exist:
official platform APIs, scheduler tools, and an AI agent driving a real
browser. This page is the decision between them, made with the API facts
verified rather than assumed, and it will send you away from the agent more
often than a page in an agent's wiki is supposed to. The per-platform
mechanics live on the sibling pages for
[Facebook](post-to-facebook-with-an-ai-agent.md),
[Instagram](post-to-instagram-with-an-ai-agent.md) and
[X](ai-agent-post-to-x.md).

First, the boundary, because it decides everything downstream: this page is
about publishing your own content to your own account, with you in the loop.
It is not about engagement automation - likes, follows or comments at scale -
not about mass posting, not about running multiple accounts, and not about
blasting the same thing into groups at volume. That is the behavior platforms
actively hunt, it is what their terms prohibit most explicitly, and it is the
fastest known way to lose an account. Nothing below applies to it.

## Route one: the official API, which wins more often than you expect

Where a platform gives you a supported way to publish, that is the right tool:
free or cheap, documented, stable, and inside the terms instead of adjacent to
them. The facts below were checked against each platform's own documentation
on 2026-09-03.

| Platform | Posting API | The fact that decides it |
|---|---|---|
| Threads | Yes, official | `POST /{threads-user-id}/threads_publish`, capped at 250 API-published posts per 24 hours |
| Bluesky | Yes, fully open | `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` on the AT Protocol, an `app.bsky.feed.post` record, your own account credentials |
| Mastodon | Yes, official | `POST /api/v1/statuses`, with a `scheduled_at` parameter, so scheduling is native |
| Facebook Page | Yes | `POST /page_id/feed` with the Pages permissions; native scheduling too |
| Facebook personal profile | No | the user feed edge does not accept creation |
| Instagram professional account | Yes | media container plus `media_publish`, 100 API-published posts per 24 hours |
| Instagram personal account | No | the publishing API covers professional accounts |
| X | Yes | `POST /2/tweets`, pay-per-usage pricing, $0.015 per standard post |

Read the first three rows again, because they are the ones this page exists to
say plainly. Threads has an official publishing API with a quota - 250
API-published posts in a 24-hour window - that no human posting schedule will
ever touch. Bluesky is built on an open protocol: creating a post is
`com.atproto.repo.createRecord`, which its own lexicon describes as "Create a
single new repository record. Requires auth, implemented by PDS", and nothing
stands between you and it except your own credentials. Mastodon's
`POST /api/v1/statuses` even takes `scheduled_at`, which its documentation
says "Must be at least 5 minutes in the future" - scheduling built into the
platform itself. For all three, "use the API" is the complete, honest answer.
An AI agent clicking through their web interfaces to post would be paying
model tokens to do badly what one HTTP request does well.

The API route has one real cost: a small amount of one-time setup - creating
an app or token, reading a quickstart - and on some platforms an account-type
or money gate. Facebook's API publishes to Pages, not personal profiles.
Instagram's publishes for professional accounts only. X charges per request.
Those gates are exactly where the other two routes begin.

## Route two: schedulers, which solve a calendar problem

If your actual problem is "this post, on these three accounts, at 9am
Tuesday, every week", the tool category built for it is the scheduler:
Buffer-class SaaS products with a content calendar, previews per platform, a
drafts queue, team approvals and retry handling. They do that work well, and
they do it through the same official APIs from route one, which means they
inherit both the APIs' legitimacy and their gates - a scheduler cannot post
to a Facebook personal profile either, because there is no API for anyone to
use.

The category has an open-source end worth knowing about:
[Postiz](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app), AGPL-3.0, self-hostable,
describing itself as "An alternative to: Buffer.com, Hypefury, Twitter
Hunter, etc..." and sitting at roughly 35 thousand GitHub stars as of this
writing. If you want scheduling without a SaaS subscription, that is the
shape of thing to evaluate.

To be clear about what this wiki's own tool is not: invisible_playwright_mcp is not a
scheduler. It has no calendar, no queue, no per-platform account connections
and no analytics. If the previous paragraph described your problem, close
this tab and go set one up. Conflict of interest declared once for the whole
page: you are reading the wiki of one of the tools being compared, which is
why the comparison spends most of its words recommending the other routes.

## Route three: an AI web agent, and the slot it honestly fills

An agent like invisible_playwright_mcp drives a real browser through your own logged-in
session, doing what you would do by hand: open the site, click the composer,
type the post, and - if you follow the rule this wiki repeats everywhere -
stop before submitting so you can read what is about to go out. That
architecture gives it exactly two honest advantages:

- **It works where no API does.** A Facebook personal profile has no posting
  API; the web interface is the only door, and a browser agent is the only
  kind of automation that can walk through it. Same for any surface a
  platform never exposed programmatically.
- **A person stays in the loop by construction.** The browser is visible, the
  session is yours, and the submit click can be yours too. For occasional
  posting where you want to read before publishing - the register this whole
  page assumes - that is a feature, not a limitation.

And the honest costs, stated with the same bluntness: an agent spends model
tokens and minutes where an API spends a fraction of a cent and milliseconds.
Web composers are exactly the custom widgets
[the forms page](ai-agent-fill-out-forms.md) warns about. Media is a hard
boundary today: invisible_playwright_mcp's toolset has no file-upload action, so a post that
needs a photo or video attached needs your hands for that step - the
platform pages spell out what that means per site. And an agent posting at
volume is indistinguishable from the behavior platforms ban, which is why
volume is out of scope here in the first place.

## Choosing, in four questions

1. **Does an official API cover your platform and account type?** Then use
   it, directly or through a scheduler. Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon: always
   yes. Facebook Pages, Instagram professional, X: yes with gates.
2. **Is the task calendar-shaped and recurring?** Scheduler, on top of those
   APIs. Open-source options exist if SaaS is the objection.
3. **Is it a personal profile, posted occasionally, with you reading before
   it ships?** That is the agent's slot. The platform pages walk it:
   [Facebook](post-to-facebook-with-an-ai-agent.md),
   [Instagram](post-to-instagram-with-an-ai-agent.md),
   [X](ai-agent-post-to-x.md).
4. **Is it any form of scale - accounts, volume, engagement?** Then it is
   outside this page, outside this tool, and inside every platform's
   enforcement priorities.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Can an AI agent post to social media for me?** Yes, by driving the web
interface of your own logged-in account, and it is the right tool only where
no API exists or where you want to review each post before it goes out.
Where an official API covers your case - Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Facebook
Pages, Instagram professional accounts, X - the API is the better answer.

**What is the best way to automate my own posts?** In order: the platform's
official API if it covers your account type; a scheduler on top of those APIs
if the problem is recurring and calendar-shaped; a browser agent only for the
surfaces APIs do not reach, with a human reviewing each post.

**Is using an AI agent to post against platform rules?** Platform terms
restrict automated access in different ways - Meta's terms require prior
permission for automated data collection, X publishes dedicated automation
rules - and the platform pages linked above quote the relevant text per site.
The register matters: your own content on your own account with human review
is the defensible end of the spectrum; scaled engagement automation is the
banned end. Account risk is yours either way, and the pages say so plainly.

**Can the agent attach images to posts?** Not by itself today: invisible_playwright_mcp's tool
vocabulary has no file-upload action. Text and link posts are within reach;
media posts need your hands for the file-picker step. The Instagram page
covers the hardest version of this, since Instagram posts require media.

**Is invisible_playwright_mcp a Buffer alternative?** No. invisible_playwright_mcp is a browser agent, not a
scheduler: no calendar, no queue, no account connections. If you want an
open-source Buffer-class tool, Postiz is that category; invisible_playwright_mcp is for tasks
that need a real browser and a person in the loop.
