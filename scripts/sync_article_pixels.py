"""One view pixel per wiki page, and the release that holds them.

A GitHub wiki serves no per-page analytics. The repository traffic API reports
the ten most visited paths over fourteen days and nothing below that, so a
corpus of hundreds of wiki pages is invisible by construction: measured on this
repository, the whole wiki index sits at about thirty views per fortnight and
not one individual page reaches the top ten.

This gives every page a counter of its own, by the same mechanism the browser
launch counter has used since May: a release asset whose `download_count` is
incremented by GitHub on every fetch. Each wiki page embeds its own asset as a
1x1 transparent image, so one page view is one fetch is one count. The assets
live in a release tagged `article-views`, which is not a software release and
is created with `make_latest=false` so it never becomes the repository's
"Latest".

What the number is, said once so nobody reads it as more than it is:

  * It counts FETCHES, not people. A reader who opens a page twice counts
    twice, and there is no unique-visitor figure anywhere in it.
  * It counts every client that loads images, crawlers included. Image
    indexers and link unfurlers fetch it exactly like a browser does. At the
    per-page volumes above, that share is not small.
  * It undercounts readers who block images or read the page through a proxy
    that strips them.

It is a floor with noise on top, and it is the only per-page signal available.
GitHub's own `traffic/popular/paths` is the independent instrument that can
corroborate it: a page the pixel calls the most read should, eventually, show
up in that top ten.

Usage:

    python scripts/sync_article_pixels.py --repo owner/name wiki_build
    python scripts/sync_article_pixels.py --repo owner/name --check wiki_build
    python scripts/sync_article_pixels.py --selftest

`--check` is the gate: it refuses unless every built page carries exactly one
pixel, addressed to this repository and naming that page. It exists because
the injection happens in `build_wiki.py`, which falls back to no pixel at all
when it is not told which repository it is building for - and a wiki published
without pixels counts nothing while looking perfectly normal.

The sync NEVER deletes an asset. A page removed from `docs/` keeps its history,
and a renamed slug gets a new asset rather than inheriting the old one's count,
which is the truth: the wiki has no redirects, so a renamed page is a new URL.
