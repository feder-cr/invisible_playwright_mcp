"""Every version on the index needs a GitHub release carrying it.

Measured 2026-09-02, on this repository: FIVE published versions, five tags, and
ZERO releases. The rule has existed for months and the two sibling packages each
have a test enforcing it. This one did not, so nothing here ever said so, and the
gap grew one release at a time without anything downstream breaking.

That is the whole reason this file exists. The releases were backfilled by hand
the same day, and a gap fixed by hand and guarded by nothing reopens on the next
release.

The release page is where a reader looks for what changed. Without it `git
describe` has nothing to say and there is no commit anybody can point at as the
source of the version they have.

WALKS EVERY VERSION, not the latest. The sibling test read `info.version` until
2026-08-02, so the moment a release shipped without its page the NEXT release
hid the omission: the check moved on and the old gap stayed behind it. Eleven
published versions across three packages turned out to have no release, three of
them published after the backfill that test was written to protect.

ONE-DIRECTIONAL on purpose, for RELEASE PAGES. A release page for a version not
yet on the index is a normal intermediate state during a publish. An index
version with no release page is the thing that gets forgotten, precisely because
nothing breaks.

⛔ AND THE OTHER DIRECTION HAS A HOLE THAT COST A RELEASE ON 2026-09-14, WHICH
THE SECOND WALK BELOW CLOSES. `v0.56.0` was tagged, the publish workflow ran,
its `gate` job died on a 504 downloading the engine from GitHub Releases, and
`upload` was therefore SKIPPED. So the tag existed, main carried the bumped
version, and the index served nothing - a state indistinguishable from a
successful release unless somebody opens the run and reads it. Nothing in this
suite could see it: this file walks the INDEX, so a version that never reached
the index is not in anything it looks at, and `test_version_is_not_taken`
answers "free" for exactly that case, which is its correct answer.

A TAG is the durable artifact of an attempted release - the release page is not,
because a failed gate skips that too - so the second walk starts from tags, and
it is bounded by AGE rather than being forbidden outright: a tag pushed a minute
ago and not yet on the index is a publish in flight, which is normal, and one
from an hour ago is a release that silently shipped nothing.

Enabled by INVISIBLE_MCP_CHECK_RELEASES, which the `releases` CI job sets. It is one API
call per version against a network service, so it does not belong in the unit
suite, and a job that sets the variable itself cannot silently skip.

#: The distributions this repository has published under, in order, each with the
#: last version that belongs to it: (name, after, through).
#:
#: ⛔ THIS REPOSITORY'S HISTORY SPANS TWO NAMES, and for half a day this file
#: looked at one. `PACKAGE` was renamed from `aihawk` to `invisible-playwright-mcp`
#: on 2026-09-23, and the check then compared THIS repository's tags against the
#: SHIM's release history: about seventy tags reported as never published, which
#: are published under `aihawk`, and two versions reported as having no release
#: page, which belong to the shim. It was asking a question with no meaning, and
#: the only thing hiding that was a transient 404 from the index tripping the
#: skip branch.
#:
#: ⛔ AND THE BOUNDARY CANNOT BE DERIVED FROM A VERSION NUMBER, because the
#: numbering OVERLAPS: `invisible-playwright-mcp` 0.1.0 through 0.16.0 was a shim
#: published from an ARCHIVED repository, and seventeen of those versions carried
#: the same number as one of ours. That is why the boundary is declared rather
#: than computed.
#:
#: The fourth field is the day the owner DELETED that project from the index, or
#: None while it is live. A deleted project answers 404, and so does an index
#: having a bad minute: nothing the index says can tell the two apart, so the
#: deletion is declared, like the boundary, and checked in the one direction the
#: index CAN answer - a project declared gone that answers 200 is a false
#: declaration and fails (`test_a_project_declared_deleted_is_not_served`).
DISTRIBUTIONS = (
    # Everything through 0.69.2 shipped as `aihawk`: 87 versions, 0.1.0 to

    # free the new name; PyPI lets a deleted name be registered again, which is
    # what made the rename possible.
    ("aihawk", None, "0.69.2", "2026-09-23"),
    # From the next version on, the new name. Below the boundary that name
    # belonged to the shim, which is gone too.

#: used in messages and for the question "is this version free".
PACKAGE = DISTRIBUTIONS[-1][0]

#: What the readers below answer when the index has never heard of the project.
#:
#: ⛔ THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, AND THE THIRD ARRIVED AS AN UNHANDLED 404. Both
#: readers went straight to `json.load`, on the assumption that the project is on
#: the index, and on 2026-09-23 the index answered 404 for both of this
#: repository's distribution names. All three tests here died inside `urllib`, in
#: a job CI runs with `INVISIBLE_MCP_CHECK_RELEASES=1`, with a traceback about
#: HTTP rather than a sentence about releases.
#:
#: ⛔ AND THAT 404 WAS READ BOTH WAYS IN ONE DAY, BOTH TIMES FROM TOO LITTLE.
#: First as a deletion, then - after the index served 87 and 19 versions for a
#: while - as a transient, on the false premise that PyPI does not let a deleted
#: name be registered again. The deletion was real and propagated unevenly: four
#: endpoints (JSON, simple, RSS, the file host) answered 404 together later that
#: day, and PyPI accepted a pending publisher for the new name, which it does only
#: for a name that does not exist. The lesson is the field above: a 404 cannot
#: say which it is, so the answer is declared, not read.
#:
#: An empty version list and an absent project are NOT the same news: a project
#: that serves no usable version is the defect this file exists to report, while
#: a project that has published nothing has nothing to report on. So the second
#: skips and says why, and the assertion that catches the first stays.
