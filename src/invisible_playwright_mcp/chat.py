#: The conversation a page that names none is in.
#:
#: ⛔ THE SAME OBJECT the server persists under, not a second string that
#: matches it. The point is not a coincidence: every client written before this
#: existed keeps landing on one conversation driving one browser. That was
#: declared twice - `"default"` here and `DEFAULT_SESSION_ID` in the mcp
#: package - with a comment saying the two had to agree and a test asserting
#: this one equalled the LITERAL `"default"`. Moving the server's default would
#: therefore have left the interface writing `chats/default.json` while the
#: server wrote `sessions/lavoro.json`, with the test that names the invariant
#: still green. One declaration cannot disagree with itself.

#: What a conversation is called before it has been asked anything.
UNNAMED = "New chat"

#: Kinds that are STATE rather than conversation: told to whoever is listening
#: NOW, and never written into the transcript.
#:
#: `busy` has been here from the start - replaying it to somebody who opens the
#: page later would show a spinner for work that finished an hour ago.
#:
#: ⛔ `fresh` JOINED IT IN 0.57.0, AND IT COULD EAT A TYPED SENTENCE. It is the
#: word that tells every page to wipe, and `reset` emits it immediately after
#: clearing the history - so it landed in the now-empty transcript and became
#: the ONE thing a cleared conversation had written down. Found by reading a
#: real saved file, not by a test: the developer's own `default.json` held
#: exactly one event, and it was this.
#:
#: What that costs is small and is the one thing this interface must not do. A
#: replayed `fresh` runs `wipe()` in the page, and `wipe()` calls
#: `setQueued(null)`: so a person who had typed a follow-up while the agent
#: worked, on a conversation that had been cleared at any point in its past,
#: lost that sentence the moment the stream reconnected from before the stored
#: `fresh` - which is exactly what a server restart does. Nothing said so.
#:
#: The live path is untouched: `/chat/fresh` still emits it and every listener
#: still wipes, which is what makes two tabs agree. A page that arrives LATER
#: needs no command, because what it is handed is already the empty transcript
#: the command would have produced.
