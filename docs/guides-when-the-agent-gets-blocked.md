# When the Agent Gets Blocked

An AI agent that browses the web inherits every way a browser can be detected,
plus a few tells of its own: the rhythm of a think-act loop, the volume of a
retry storm, the fingerprint of the machine it runs on. These pages sort out
which is which, because the fix is different for each - and some of them are
not fixable from the agent at all.

The mechanism layer lives on the
[invisible_playwright wiki](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki),
which documents the fingerprinting surfaces and the detection vendors in
depth. The pages here stay at the level of the agent: what happened, what to
check, in what order.
