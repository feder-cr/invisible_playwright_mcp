# Firecrawl vs an AI browser agent

Here is the answer before the article. If your task is "URLs go in,
LLM-ready content comes out" - feeding a RAG pipeline, summarizing pages,
building a corpus - Firecrawl or something shaped like it wins over a browser
agent on cost, speed and simplicity, and it is not close. If your task needs
things to happen - logged-in sessions, forms filled, multi-step flows where
the next click depends on what the page said - a crawl API is the wrong tool
category, and an agent driving a real browser is the right one. Everything
below is the reasoning, the numbers, and the overlap where the choice gets
genuinely interesting.

Disclosure first: this wiki belongs to
[invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp), an open-source AI browser
agent, so we are a vendor of exactly one side of this comparison. Every
Firecrawl fact below was read from Firecrawl's own repository, site or
documentation on 2026-09-03, and the paragraph conceding their side is not
smaller than the one favoring ours.

## What Firecrawl actually is

Firecrawl calls itself "the context API to search, scrape, and interact with
the web at scale", and the shape of the product is exactly that sentence: an
API. You send a URL and get back clean markdown or structured JSON built for
model consumption; a `/crawl` endpoint follows links across a site; a
`/search` endpoint returns results with full-page markdown included. It is
the most-adopted project of its kind by a huge margin - about 176,000 GitHub
stars when read on 2026-09-03.

The licensing is worth thirty seconds because it is layered. The core
repository is AGPL-3.0; the SDKs and some UI components are MIT. And the
hosted cloud is more than the open code: Firecrawl's own self-hosting guide
states that Fire-engine, the fetching layer it credits with the cloud's
"advanced anti-bot behavior" and some capabilities like screenshots, "is not
included" in the self-hosted stack. Their words, their architecture, and a
fair thing to know before you assume the AGPL repo equals the product at
firecrawl.dev.

One more of their claims, quoted because it is the honest center of their
pitch: clean markdown "with 93% fewer input tokens for your model" compared
to raw page content. That number is Firecrawl's own measurement, but the
direction is obviously right - stripped markdown is far smaller than raw
HTML, and token cost is the tax every LLM pipeline pays.

## What an AI browser agent actually is

An agent is a different machine entirely: a language model in a loop with a
real browser, reading the page, deciding an action, performing it, and
repeating until the goal is met.
[The explainer](ai-web-agent-explained.md) covers the loop; the property that
matters here is that nothing is scripted in advance. The model decides at run
time, which is what lets an agent do errands - sign in, navigate, fill,
submit, retry - and also what makes it slower and more expensive per page
than any API call will ever be.

## The one question that decides it

Does your task read the web, or act on it?

Reading at volume is Firecrawl's home game. Acting is the agent's. The
boundary is sharper than it first looks, because Firecrawl does have an
interaction feature and it is worth describing precisely: its scrape can run
a caller-provided sequence of actions before extraction - write, press,
click, wait, screenshot. That is scripting, not deciding. You write the
sequence in advance against a page structure you already know, which puts it
in the same family as a Playwright script: excellent when the steps are known
and stable, brittle when the page changes, and unable to handle a flow whose
next step depends on judgment. The distinction between scripted and decided
is the entire subject of
[AI browser agents vs traditional scraping](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md);
this page is the named-tool version of it, and the general cost math lives
there, not here.

## Where Firecrawl wins, said loudly

For content-to-LLM at any real volume, the crawl API side wins on every axis
that pays the bills:

- **Cost per page.** An API call versus an agent loop that sends the page
  through a model at least once, usually several times. The agent's cost per
  page is orders of magnitude higher, and their "93% fewer input tokens"
  framing shows they know exactly which axis they are selling.
- **Speed and parallelism.** Requests fan out; an agent's loop turns are
  serial and model-latency bound.
- **Operational simplicity.** No browser fleet, no loop to supervise, no
  non-deterministic wandering to cap. URL in, markdown out.
- **The ecosystem agrees.** This is the category that feeds RAG pipelines
  and model context, and Firecrawl's adoption is the measure of the fit.

If that list is your task, use the API. An agent aimed at bulk extraction is
a misallocation: slower, costlier, and non-deterministic where determinism
was on offer, and this is an agent's own wiki saying so.

## Where the agent wins

The agent's territory is everything an API request cannot be:

- **State.** A logged-in session that persists across steps, a cart, a
  wizard, a dashboard behind auth that expects a real, continuous visitor.
- **Actions with consequences.** Submitting, booking, applying, replying,
  changing settings: tasks where the deliverable is a changed website, not
  a document ([the forms page](ai-agent-fill-out-forms.md) is the honest
  account of how well that goes).
- **Judgment mid-flow.** "Find the cheapest of these that ships this week
  and order it" cannot be pre-scripted, because the branch points depend on
  content nobody has seen yet.
- **Unknown structure.** One instruction across twenty differently-built
  sites, where writing twenty action sequences costs more than the answer.

invisible_playwright_mcp sits on this side, and the differentiator we bring is the browser
itself: a real Firefox patched at the C++ level rather than a headless
Chromium in a datacenter, running locally, with identity derived from a seed
so a failing run replays. The boundary stays where our wiki always puts it:
that addresses what a page reads from the browser, and does nothing for your
IP, pacing, or a site's limits -
[why agents get blocked](why-does-my-ai-agent-get-blocked.md) is the full
map, and it applies to hosted crawl APIs and agents alike.

## The hybrid, because production usually wants both

The two categories compose better than they compete:

- **Agent for the errand, API for the volume.** Use an agent to reach the
  state that matters (find the section, work out the path), then hand the
  URL space to a crawl API for the thousand-page sweep.
- **API for the corpus, agent for the exceptions.** Route everything through
  the cheap path and send only the pages that need interaction or judgment
  to the agent, keeping the blended cost near the API's.
- **Monitoring split.** Watching pages for change is API-shaped work;
  reacting to a change with a multi-step task is agent-shaped
  ([the monitoring page](how-to-monitor-a-page-with-an-ai-agent.md) walks
  that line).

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Is Firecrawl an AI agent?** No, and it does not claim to be. It is a
hosted API that turns web pages into LLM-ready markdown and JSON, with
optional pre-scripted page actions. No model decides the next step inside
Firecrawl's loop; your pipeline consumes its output.

**Firecrawl vs Playwright?** Different layers. Playwright is a library you
program to drive a browser you run; Firecrawl is a hosted service that does
the fetching and cleaning for you. A Playwright script and Firecrawl's
action sequences are cousins; an agent is the third thing, a model deciding
at run time.

**Firecrawl vs Browserbase?** Also different layers, easy to conflate
because both are infrastructure: Firecrawl sells extracted content,
Browserbase sells the browsers themselves for your code to drive. The
[infrastructure explainer](cloud-browser-infrastructure-for-ai-agents.md)
covers that category.

**Can Firecrawl log in and fill forms?** It can execute a scripted sequence
you provide (write, click, press, wait) before extracting. What it cannot do
is decide the sequence: flows that branch on page content need an agent.

**Is Firecrawl open source?** The core repo is AGPL-3.0 and the SDKs are
MIT, but the cloud's fetching layer (Fire-engine) is a separate service
their self-host docs say is not included. Self-hosters get a real product,
not the whole product.

**Which is cheaper?** For reading pages at volume, Firecrawl-shaped APIs, by
orders of magnitude per page. For a task, the comparison stops making sense:
an API cannot do a task, so the agent's token bill is the price of the
category, not a premium over the API.

agent, and this page's first paragraph hands bulk extraction to the other
category anyway. If we only won half the comparisons, we would rather be
trusted on that half.*
