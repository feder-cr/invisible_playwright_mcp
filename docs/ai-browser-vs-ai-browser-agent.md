# AI browser vs AI browser agent: which one do you want?

The two terms get used interchangeably and they name opposite things. An
**AI browser** is a browser you use, with an AI built into the window:
you do the browsing, it summarizes, answers, and increasingly offers to
take the wheel for a task. An **AI browser agent** is software that does
the browsing: you state a goal, it drives a browser - often one you never
see - and returns the result. One is a better window; the other is a
worker. Most disappointment in this category comes from buying one when
the problem needed the other, so this page draws the line, lists what
actually exists on each side as of September 2026, and gives you the
test.

Disclosure, as on every comparison here: this wiki belongs to
[invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp), an open-source project on
the agent side of the line. Product statuses below were verified against
vendors' pages and coverage on 2026-09-03.

## The AI browser: software you browse with

The category's living products, checked this session:

**Comet (Perplexity).** A Chromium-based browser with Perplexity's
assistant built in, able to summarize, draft, and act on pages. It
rolled out on Windows and macOS from July 2025, Android in November
2025, and iOS in March 2026, and has been free for everyone since late
2025. It is currently the most complete consumer AI browser: real
platforms, no paywall, an assistant that can take actions in the page.
Worth knowing when you weigh the category: researchers demonstrated a
prompt injection exploit dubbed CometJacking, which Perplexity
disputed and then patched - assistants that act on live pages inherit
live-page risks, whichever vendor ships them.

**Dia (The Browser Company, under Atlassian).** Atlassian agreed to buy
The Browser Company for $610 million in September 2025 with Dia as the
focus. Dia today is in beta, macOS 14+ on Apple silicon only, and leans
knowledge-work: briefs of your calendar and inbox, synthesis across
tools, chat with your tabs. Design-forward and promising, but a Windows
user cannot run it, and it is a workplace bet more than a general one.

**Chrome with Gemini.** The incumbent went AI browser in place: a Gemini
side panel, and since 28 January 2026 the auto browse agent for AI Pro
and Ultra subscribers in the US, which drives pages in a marked tab with
an action log and confirmation gates. Chrome is the clearest evidence
that the AI browser is becoming a feature of every browser rather than
a product category.

**ChatGPT's browsing surfaces.** OpenAI tried a standalone AI browser -
Atlas, launched October 2025 - and shut it down in August 2026,
concluding, per coverage of the shutdown, that the browser is "a
feature, not the destination". What remains is agentic browsing inside
the ChatGPT desktop app and a Chrome extension. **Claude in Chrome**
(generally available on paid Claude plans since 26 August 2026) takes
the same extension-shaped route: your Chrome, with an AI that can act
in it.

Read the pattern across those four: every AI browser is growing an agent
mode, and one vendor already concluded the standalone AI browser was not
worth shipping. The category is converging on "your browser, plus an
assistant that sometimes acts".

## The AI browser agent: software that browses for you

On this side, the browser is a tool the software holds, not a window you
look through. You interact with a prompt, a script, a schedule or an
assistant; the agent interacts with the web.

The shapes it comes in:

- **Hosted general agents** - Manus, ChatGPT Work, Gemini Agent - take a
  goal and run it on vendor infrastructure;
  [Manus alternatives](manus-alternatives.md) maps that shelf and its
  ownership turbulence.
- **Open-source agents you run** - browser-use, Skyvern, Agent S, and
  our own invisible_playwright_mcp - live on your machine with your model key. The
  directory pages are
  [Open-source AI browser agents](ai-browser-agent-open-source.md) and
  [Open-source computer-use agents](computer-use-agent-open-source.md).
- **API building blocks** - the computer use tools in the Gemini and
  Claude APIs - for building your own;
  [Gemini computer use vs Claude computer use](gemini-computer-use-vs-claude-computer-use.md)
  referees those.

The agent side is what you want when the task is the point and watching
it is not: extraction to a file, monitoring a page on a schedule,
filling the same form forty times, research that spans thirty tabs you
never want open. It is also the side that can run headless, on a server,
from cron, or inside an MCP assistant - none of which a browser you
browse with can do for you.

## The line that survives the blur

Auto browse in Chrome and Comet's assistant genuinely act on pages, so
"browsers do not act" is already false. The distinction that still
holds is structural:

- **Whose session and identity does the work?** An AI browser acts as
  you, in your logged-in profile, on your machine, while you watch. An
  agent runs its own browser - its own profile, possibly its own
  fingerprint and egress - and can do so without you present.
- **What is the unit of use?** A browser's unit is a browsing session
  you are having. An agent's unit is a task: it can be scripted,
  scheduled, parallelized and piped, which is why
  [extraction](how-to-extract-data-to-csv-with-an-ai-agent.md),
  [monitoring](how-to-monitor-a-page-with-an-ai-agent.md) and
  [research](ai-agent-web-research.md) live on the agent side of this
  wiki.
- **Who is accountable to the page?** In an AI browser, sites see your
  normal browser with you behind it. An agent's browser answers a
  page's questions itself, which is where the engineering under agents
  diverges - what a site can tell, and what that costs, is
  [its own section here](guides-when-the-agent-gets-blocked.md).

## Which one do you want?

- **You browse all day and want it to hurt less** - summaries, drafting,
  tab wrangling, an occasional "just do this bit for me": AI browser.
  Comet if you want it free and cross-platform today; Chrome if you
  want it inside what you already run; Dia if you are macOS and
  work-tool centric.
- **You have tasks, and the browser is incidental to them**: agent. If
  the tasks are occasional and you already pay OpenAI, Google or
  Anthropic, their built-in agents cover the easy cases. If the tasks
  recur, need scheduling, touch your own infrastructure, or you want
  the code, use the open-source shelf - start at
  [Choosing an AI browser agent](best-ai-browser-agent.md).
- **You want both**: they compose. A browser with an assistant for your
  hands-on hours, an agent for the work that should not need you.
  Nothing about the choice is exclusive except your budget.

The disclosure, once more, because this is the paragraph where it
matters: we make an agent, so "you probably want an agent" is exactly
what we would say. The test we actually stand behind cuts both ways -
if you would watch it work, you wanted a browser; if watching it work
would be a waste of your afternoon, you wanted an agent.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**What is the difference between an AI browser and an AI browser
agent?** An AI browser is a browser you use with AI in it; an agent is
software that operates a browser for you, often unattended.

**Is Comet an AI browser or an agent?** A browser - with an assistant
that can act on the page you are on. It does not run unattended tasks
on your behalf the way agent software does.

**Is ChatGPT an AI browser?** OpenAI's standalone browser, Atlas, shut
down in August 2026; ChatGPT now offers agentic browsing inside its
desktop app and a Chrome extension.

**Are AI browsers safe?** They inherit live-page risks: Comet's
CometJacking prompt injection exploit was demonstrated and patched, and
every vendor gates sensitive actions behind confirmations. The same
category of risk applies to agents, where you choose the guardrails.

**Do I need an AI browser to use an AI browser agent?** No. Agents
bring their own browser - invisible_playwright_mcp ships its own patched Firefox, others
drive Chromium builds - and run alongside whatever you browse with.

**Can one product do both?** Chrome with auto browse is the closest
today: a normal browser that can hand a tab to an agent. The unattended,
scripted, scheduled cases remain agent territory.

the agent category from first principles,

agents that sit above both categories.
