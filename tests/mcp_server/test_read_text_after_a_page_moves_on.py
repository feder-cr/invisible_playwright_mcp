"""`browser_read_text` right after `browser_navigate`, on pages that replace
themselves, in a browser.

⛔ THE KNOWN-BAD INPUT, from the invisible_dots VMs (2026-10-12): a read right
after navigating to a page that calls `location.replace` 50 ms after `load`
failed with the engine's raw "Failed to find execution context" 9 times in 10.
`read_text` found the element with one call and read it with a second, and the
page moved on between them. It finds and reads in one call now, and from
invisible-playwright 0.35.0 a call caught by the move is made again on the page
that took its place.

The pages: a redirect from the `<head>`, and 0, 50 and 300 ms after `load`,
each to the same site and to another one (127.0.0.1 to localhost, which the
browser puts in another process). Five rounds each: a race missed once in five
is still a race. A selector that matches nothing still says so at once.

⛔ AND THE SNAPSHOT AND READ_HTML, EACH AS THE FIRST READ AFTER THE NAVIGATION.
They run their own fixed reads in the page's world; until invisible-playwright
0.35.2 they went through `page.evaluate`, which from 0.35.2 sends the code once
and raises Playwright's navigation error when the page moves under it (the
model's code must not run twice, [B285]). They ask `page.evaluate_read`, which
reads again on the page that replaced the one they went to.

⛔ AND THE SAME REPORT'S 45 s `browser_navigate`. Each round navigates while
the previous page's own `location.replace` may be in flight, and Firefox lets
that one win: ours is never heard of again, no commit and no abort. The wait
used to run to the timeout; since invisible-core 41.36.0 the first document
committed after the command decides, and when it is not ours the navigation
answers at once with upstream Playwright's "is interrupted by another
navigation to", naming the page the browser went to. A round may end that
way. It may not take long, and the read after it still answers with the page.
