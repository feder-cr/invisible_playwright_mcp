"""MCP server exposing two stealth browsers, `main` and `support`.

⛔ THERE IS NO SESSION CONCEPT HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE - not an omission,
and not the same claim this file made a day earlier when a session held up to
eight named browsers. This process serves exactly ONE piece of work: the two
fixed browsers above, and nothing a tool can enumerate, name or reach a SECOND
one of. `INVISIBLE_MCP_SESSION_ID`, read once from the environment near the top of
this file, decides which saved file that one piece of work persists to - set
by whoever spawns this process, never by a tool argument, never published in
a schema, never something a model can read or pass. A model working through
this server cannot ask "what else is there" because there is no "else" to ask
about.

Tool names mirror the Microsoft Playwright MCP so prompts stay portable, with
one deliberate departure: there are no tab tools. A browser here drives ONE
page. Playwright's MCP offers `browser_tab_*` and this server briefly did too;
they were removed because the case they serve is better served by `support` -
a second tab carries the identity's cookies and fingerprint to the second
site, which is the one thing the two browsers exist to keep apart.

Config comes from STEALTHFOX_* env vars. Nothing here opens a browser but
`browser_open`; a tool whose browser is not open, or gone, says so and names
that call. `work.py` is where that rule lives.

Every tool here is a wrapper. The operations live in `actions.py` and the
browsers in `work.py`, so every client drives them through exactly the same
code rather than through a second implementation that would drift from this
one. (This said `registry.py` until 2026-09-16, a file that has not existed
since the eight-browser session became one piece of work - a present-tense
sentence pointing a reader at nothing.)

Transport is stdio by default, which is what existing clients expect. Set
STEALTHFOX_MCP_TRANSPORT=http to serve over streamable HTTP instead, which is
what lets more than one client attach to the same live browser.

THERE IS NO INTERFACE HERE, and that is the point rather than an omission. This
package served a two-pane page and a live view until 0.9.0, reaching the browser
through `registry` because it was in the same process. Both moved to `invisible_playwright_mcp`,
which now reaches the browser over MCP like anybody else. What that buys is not
tidiness: it means no client has a privileged path, so the tools below are
provably sufficient for the flagship interface, because the flagship interface
is a client of them. A page kept inside the server is a page whose needs quietly
become the server's requirements.

# The ladder, stated once. Each tool's own description says what that tool does;

# nothing had told it they were rungs.
#
# ⛔ AND WHAT FOLLOWS THE LADDER WAS MEASURED ON A HOST'S RUNS: 45 tasks of
# invisible_dots that drove a page, 773 page calls, 90 of which led nowhere
# (2026-10-10). 58 of the 90 were addresses from memory: 27 of the 54 pages
# dropped unread answered 404, against 1 of 40 pages that were read. A Brave
# search was the one that gave this browser usable results (DuckDuckGo's html
# version wraps its links in a redirect, Bing gave an empty results area).
# Four clicks waited their 15 seconds under a consent dialog before the model
# answered it. And going back or loading a page again has no tool here: a key
# pressed on the page never reaches the browser's own shortcuts, so a
# navigation is the way, and one to the page's own address loads it again.
PAGE_RULES = """Drive the page the way a person would. Everything here goes
through the real pointer and the real keyboard.

Try things in this order. It matters, because a page can tell the difference.

1. A named tool with a selector: browser_click, browser_type,
   browser_select_option, browser_press_key, browser_upload_files.
   browser_snapshot gives you the selector for each element - pass it
   verbatim, it is built to be unambiguous.

2. Coordinates. browser_snapshot reports `at: [x, y]` for every element it
   lists, in viewport pixels. browser_click_at takes exactly those and moves the
   pointer there. This is the rung for anything a selector does not describe: a
   canvas, a slider, a map, a custom widget built out of divs.

3. Your eyes. browser_take_screenshot, find the thing in the picture, then
   browser_click_at on where it is. For what the snapshot does not list at all.

4. browser_evaluate, to READ what none of the above can see.

browser_evaluate refuses the obvious ways to act on the page, and names the tool
to use instead: assigning to value, checked or selected, or calling click(),
dispatchEvent(), submit() or requestSubmit(). All of those skip the keyboard and
the pointer, so the event arrives with isTrusted false - the single clearest
signal that something other than a person is driving, and avoiding it is what
this browser is for. When you want that, rung 2 or rung 3 is what you actually
want.

That refusal is a guardrail on the obvious road, not a wall around the field.
JavaScript has unlimited ways to say the same thing and this catches the ones
worth catching, so DO NOT read a silent pass as permission: if you find a way to
change the page through browser_evaluate, that is the bug, and saying so in your
answer is worth more than using it.

You do not need script to read state back, either. The snapshot carries
`checked` for a checkbox or radio and `value` for a select, alongside the text.

A cookie or consent dialog covers the page until it is answered: a click on
anything under it waits and fails. When browser_snapshot shows one, click one of
its buttons first. A date field that is a calendar wants its days clicked, not
typed.

If you get to the bottom of the ladder and still cannot do the thing, say so in
your answer. A task reported as impossible is worth more than a task completed
in a way that gets you blocked, and a number or a fact you could not read on the
page is not one to give.

Reach a page through a link you have seen or an address you were given, not one
you remember: sites move their pages, and an address from memory often answers
404. browser_snapshot lists a page's links with their URLs, and a site's own
menu and search reach what you cannot guess. From nothing, search: navigate to
https://search.brave.com/search?q=<your words> and read the results with
browser_snapshot, whose URLs are real. After a 404, the next address comes from
a page that loaded or from a search, not from memory.

A browser drives ONE page, and there is no way to open, list, choose or close
another: browser_navigate opens the page and every other tool acts on it. Going
somewhere else and coming back is a navigation, not a second window: to go
back, navigate to the address you came from, and to load a page again, navigate
to its own address."""

_TWO_BROWSERS = """There are two browsers, and every tool takes `browser`.

`main` is your own identity: its page, its cookies, its logins, its
fingerprint. That is where the work happens, and it is where a command goes

`support` is a helper for anything that must NOT touch that identity. The case
it exists for: you are signing up somewhere and need a mailbox for the
verification, so you open `support`, go to a throwaway-mail site there, take the
address, type it into the form in `main`, and come back to `support` for the
link. A second page inside `main` would carry the same cookies and the same
fingerprint to both sites, and then the account and the mailbox are one person
to anyone looking. When you need a second page, that is what `support` is.

Open it with browser_open when the task needs it, and close it with
browser_close as soon as the task no longer needs it, before you give your
answer: it costs a real browser, it is not saved, and it goes away when this
