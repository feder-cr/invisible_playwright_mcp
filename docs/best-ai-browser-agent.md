# Choosing an AI browser agent

There is no best AI browser agent, and a page that names one without asking
about your task is selling something. What exists is a small set of axes on
which the real tools genuinely differ, and once you place your task on those
axes the field usually narrows itself to one or two candidates. This page is
the axes, a short decision path, and the cluster of detailed comparisons
around it.

The conflict of interest, up front: this is the wiki of
[invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp), an open-source agent that
appears below as one of the candidates. Every claim about another tool on this
page and its siblings traces to that tool's own site, repository or
documentation, retrieved 2026-09-03, and the pages say so where a competitor
covers more than we do. If you first want the category itself explained,
start at [what an AI web agent is](ai-web-agent-explained.md).

## Axis 1: who brings the model

Three answers exist, and they sort the field cleanly.

**The vendor brings it.** ChatGPT's agentic browsing and Claude in Chrome run
on their vendor's models under your subscription. Least setup, least control,
and the capability lives at the vendor's pleasure - the Operator-to-agent-to-
removal churn of 2025-2026 is the cautionary tale, told with dates on
[Is OpenAI Operator still available?](is-openai-operator-still-available.md).

**You bring a key.** browser-use, Skyvern, Agent S3 and invisible_playwright_mcp take an API
key and let you choose the model. You pay per token, you can switch providers,
and the agent keeps working when a vendor reorganizes a product line.

**You build the loop.** Claude computer use and OpenAI's computer use tool
are API offerings: the vendor supplies the model's ability
to click and type, you supply everything else. Maximum control, real
engineering cost - the architecture is dissected on
[OpenAI Operator vs Claude computer use](openai-operator-vs-claude-computer-use.md).

## Axis 2: what browser it drives, and how

This is the axis buyers skip and then rediscover the hard way, because it
decides what a website sees when it looks back.

- **An extension in your real browser** (ChatGPT's Chrome extension, Claude
  in Chrome): the browser is genuinely yours, history and all; the agent is
  bounded by the vendor's safety envelope.
- **A stock automation build, driven over an automation protocol**
  (browser-use, Skyvern): the standard stack, with
  [its own observable characteristics](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/bidi-vs-cdp-detection)
  and [a build that is not the retail browser](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/chromium-is-not-chrome).
- **A screenshot loop over a whole desktop** (Agent S3, Claude computer use):
  most general, heaviest per action -
  [DOM reading versus pixel reading is a real fork](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/dom-reading-vs-screenshot-agents).
- **A browser modified at the source level** (invisible_playwright_mcp's engine): a Firefox
  patched in C++ to present a normal desktop fingerprint, with identity
  derived from a seed so runs replay. This is our approach, and the axis where
  we have something the others do not; the mechanics live on the
  [engine wiki](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/do-websites-know-you-are-using-a-script)
  rather than in adjectives here.

## Axis 3: where it runs

On your machine, in the tool's cloud, or in the vendor's product. Local runs
keep data and credentials with you and cost only tokens; clouds (Browser Use
Cloud, Skyvern Cloud) sell scale and management; vendor products keep both
the model and the environment. One non-obvious note for local runs: the
machine itself answers some of a website's questions, and
[a bare server answers them badly](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/headless-browser-agent-on-a-server).

## Axis 4: what happens when a site pushes back

The axis nobody's landing page volunteers. Some sites challenge automated
visitors, and how a tool degrades matters more than how it demos.

Be clear about what is whose: the browser's fingerprint and build are the
tool's responsibility; the IP's reputation, the account's standing, and the
pacing of requests are yours, whatever tool you run. No agent on this page,
ours included, guarantees passage anywhere, and a tool that promises you will
never be blocked is describing a world with no defenders in it. invisible_playwright_mcp's
position on this axis is a hardened, real-fingerprint browser plus documented
limits, not a guarantee. The sorting of blame - and what to actually do -
is [why an agent gets blocked](why-does-my-ai-agent-get-blocked.md), and
[the timing signal specific to agents](ai-agent-timing-signal.md)
is worth reading before blaming any browser.

Also on this axis: whether you should be automating the site at all. Terms of
service, rate limits, and a human reviewing anything submitted are your job,
not the tool's.

## The decision path

1. **Occasional tasks, already paying a vendor?** Use that vendor's browsing
   agent (ChatGPT's, or Claude in Chrome). Stop here.
2. **Need the agent as software you control?** Open source, your key. Go on.
3. **Does the task leave the browser for the desktop?** Agent S3. See
   [open-source computer-use agents](computer-use-agent-open-source.md).
4. **Is it browser-only and the default stack works on your target?**
   browser-use - biggest ecosystem, reasonable default. Its trade-offs:
   [browser-use alternatives](browser-use-alternatives.md).
5. **Layouts churn and break flows?** Skyvern's vision-first approach.
6. **The browser itself is being recognized, you need runs to replay, or you
   want the agent inside Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor via MCP?**
   invisible_playwright_mcp - noting we are the ones saying it, and that it is Windows/Linux
   only.
7. **Still tied?** Run the finalists on your real task for an afternoon each.
   Every open tool here installs in one command; the trial costs less than
   choosing wrong.

## The cluster around this page

The detailed comparisons this hub summarizes:

- [OpenAI Operator alternatives](openai-operator-alternatives.md) - the full
  field, hosted and open, after Operator's shutdown.
- [Open-source Operator-style agents](openai-operator-open-source.md) - repo
  by repo, with stars, licenses and the "open operator" name collisions.
- [Is OpenAI Operator still available?](is-openai-operator-still-available.md) -
  the verified 2025-2026 timeline: Operator, agent mode, Atlas.
- [OpenAI Operator vs Claude computer use](openai-operator-vs-claude-computer-use.md) -
  the two big-vendor architectures, one of which no longer exists.
- [browser-use alternatives](browser-use-alternatives.md) - the category
  leader's real trade-offs, without invented grievances.
- And around the cluster:
  [open-source AI browser agents](ai-browser-agent-open-source.md),

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**What is the best AI browser agent in 2026?** For most people starting cold:
browser-use, on ecosystem size. The word "best" stops meaning anything the
moment your task hits one of the four axes above, which is what the decision
path is for.

**Are the vendor agents (ChatGPT, Claude) better than open source?** They are
more convenient and more bounded. Open agents are yours: your key, your
machine, your code, and no product-line reorg can remove them - which 2026
demonstrated is not hypothetical.

**Which agent is undetectable?** None, and the claim itself is a red flag.
Tools differ in what the browser presents; the IP, account and pacing remain
yours. See [why an agent gets blocked](why-does-my-ai-agent-get-blocked.md).

**Do I need an AI agent at all, or just a scraper?** If the task needs
judgment about what is on the page, an agent. If it is the same extraction
repeated, [a script is cheaper and faster](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md).

**What does an open-source agent cost to run?** The software is free; model
tokens are the cost. Screenshot-heavy approaches spend more tokens per action
than DOM-reading ones - that is an architecture property, not a pricing table.

**Why should I trust a buyer's guide written by a vendor?** You should not,
on faith. Trust the links: every factual claim traces to the named tool's own
material, and the disclosure is at the top instead of the bottom.
