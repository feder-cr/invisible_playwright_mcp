# How to let Claude Desktop control a browser

Claude Desktop does not take the one-line command that Claude Code does; it
reads its MCP servers from a JSON settings file. The exact block to paste and
the file it goes in are documented once, in the
[MCP server page](mcp-server.md), and
this page deliberately does not duplicate them: one copy, on that page, is the one kept current.
What this page covers is everything around that block: what actually changes in
Desktop once the server is in, what to try first, what the tool calls look like
while Claude works, and the first-run issues that generate most of the
questions.

One boundary before anything else, because it decides whether to read on:
Claude Desktop runs on macOS and Windows, and invisible_playwright_mcp's engine ships for Windows
and Linux, with macOS unsupported. The overlap is Windows. On a Mac, Desktop
will start the server and the server will have no engine build to run; this
combination is a Windows setup today.

## What changes after the server is added

Mechanically: you edit the config (Desktop's Settings, under Developer, has an
Edit Config button that opens the right file), paste the server block from the
README, then quit Desktop completely and restart it. The full restart is not
superstition; Desktop loads MCP servers at startup, and the official MCP
quickstart lists "restart Claude Desktop completely" as the first
troubleshooting step for a server that does not appear.

After the restart, the same Claude you already talk to has a real browser. The
server exposes a flat set of tools in two families: browser tools that open
and report the two browsers (`browser_open`, `browser_close`, `browser_list`,
`browser_status`) and page tools that act on the page one of them is driving
(`browser_navigate`, `browser_read_text`, `browser_snapshot`,
`browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_take_screenshot`, and a few more).
Claude sees the list and decides when to use them; you do not invoke tools
yourself, you ask for outcomes.

Two things notably do not change. There is no new account and no new key: your
existing Claude subscription is the model, the server brings only the browser,
and the config block carries no secret. And nothing happens eagerly: no browser
launches at startup, and nothing downloads until the first instruction that
actually needs a page.

## First prompts to try

Start small and visible, because the first prompt doubles as the installation
test:

> Open https://books.toscrape.com/ and tell me the title and price of the
> first book on the page.

That one prompt exercises the whole path: server starts, engine found (or
fetched, see below), page loaded, text read, answer grounded in the page. The
example site is a sandbox built for practice, which is exactly what a first
run is.

Then something with a decision in it:

> On that same site, go to page two and tell me whether any book there is
> priced under ten pounds. Quote the cheapest one.

And when it is earning its keep, point it at your own work: a staging page or a
local dev server is the best second session, because you know the ground truth.
For anything form-shaped, [the forms page](ai-agent-fill-out-forms.md) is the
honest account of what to expect.

Keep early instructions to one clear step. The agent behind these tools works
observe-act-observe, and short instructions produce transcripts you can read
when something goes wrong, which at the start is the point.

## What the tool calls look like

Desktop makes the agent loop unusually visible, and it is worth watching once.
When Claude decides to act, the tool call appears in the conversation by name
with its arguments - `browser_navigate` with a URL, `browser_click` with a
selector - and by default Desktop asks for your approval before each action
runs. You can allow individually, and you can deny; nothing touches the page
without a click from you. The tool's result then returns into the
conversation: page text for the reading tools, an image for
`browser_take_screenshot`.

Two consequences of that design are worth naming. First, the approvals are a
feature, not friction: a browser that acts on the real web under your account
deserves a human gate, and the gate is also where you catch a wrong step before
it happens. Second, the browser itself is headless by default, so there is no
window to watch; the screenshot tool is your eyes. If you want an actual
window, the server reads `STEALTHFOX_HEADLESS=0` from its environment - set in
the same config block, and documented, like the rest of the server's
environment variables, in its README.

The server list itself lives behind the connectors control at the bottom of
Desktop's input box; the MCP quickstart walks the exact clicks. If the server
is missing from that list after a restart, the config did not load, and that
is a syntax or path problem, not an invisible_playwright_mcp one.

## Common first-run issues

In the order people hit them:

1. **The first real prompt answers that the engine is downloading.** The
   engine is about a quarter of a gigabyte and the server fetches it on its
   own from the moment Desktop starts it; a browser asked for before that is
   done is answered with the download's progress, not opened, and asking again
   a minute later is all it takes. To get it over with first, in a terminal
   where you can watch progress:

   ```bash
   uvx invisible-playwright fetch
   ```

   The engine is cached afterwards and shared with every other way into
   invisible_playwright_mcp.

2. **The server never appears.** Almost always the restart (must be a full
   quit, not closing the window) or JSON syntax in the config. Desktop writes
   MCP logs - a general `mcp.log` plus a per-server log carrying the server's
   own errors - and the MCP quickstart documents where they live on each
   platform. Read the per-server log before guessing.

3. **`uvx` is not found.** The config launches the server with `uvx`, which
   means [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) must be installed, and installed
   where a GUI application can see it. A shell that finds `uvx` does not
   guarantee Desktop does, since GUI apps do not always inherit your shell's
   PATH; if the per-server log shows a not-found error, the paragraph "Added is not connected" on the [MCP server page](mcp-server.md) is the place to start.

4. **It is a Mac.** No engine build, per the boundary at the top. Nothing to
   debug.

5. **A page loads but the site pushes back.** That is not a Desktop problem
   and usually not a browser problem; work through
   [why agents get blocked](why-does-my-ai-agent-get-blocked.md) before
   changing anything.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**How do I add invisible_playwright_mcp's browser to Claude Desktop?** Paste the server block
from the [MCP server page](mcp-server.md)
into Desktop's MCP config (Settings, Developer, Edit Config), then fully quit
and restart Desktop. The block and the file path live on that page on purpose.

**Do I need an API key for this?** No. Your Claude subscription is the model;
the server only adds the browser, and its config block contains no secret. The
OpenRouter key belongs to a different way in, invisible_playwright_mcp's own interface
(`uvx invisible-playwright-mcp ui`), which requires one.

**Why does the first instruction say the engine is downloading?** The server
fetches the engine, about a quarter of a gigabyte, when it starts, and reports
the progress instead of waiting. Prefetch it with
`uvx invisible-playwright fetch` and the first instruction behaves like every
later one.

**Why can I not see the browser?** It runs headless by default; screenshots
through the `browser_take_screenshot` tool are the intended window. The
server's `STEALTHFOX_HEADLESS=0` environment variable shows a real window if
you want one.

**Does Claude act without asking me?** By default, no: Desktop asks approval
per tool call, and you can deny any of them. Treat that gate as part of the
workflow, especially for actions with consequences; the position on submissions
in [the forms page](ai-agent-fill-out-forms.md) applies here unchanged.

**Does this work on a Mac?** Not today. Desktop runs there, but the engine has
no macOS build, so the working combination is Windows (or Linux through other
clients).
