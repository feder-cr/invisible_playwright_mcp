"""Build the Gemini CLI extension archives from this repository, and refuse
one that carries what it must not.

Installed from the git URL, the extension is a clone of the whole repository:
measured 2026-09-21, `gemini extensions install https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp`
put docs, articles, tests and src on the person's disk to deliver two files,
`gemini-extension.json` and the setup skill. Gemini CLI installs from a
GitHub release instead when the Latest release carries an asset it can pick:
`{platform}.{name}.{extension}` per platform, or a single asset as the
fallback. Ours carry two MCP bundles already, so the fallback never applies
and the per-platform names are the road: three identical archives, one per
platform Gemini names (`darwin`, `linux`, `win32`), each fully contained,
with `gemini-extension.json` at its root. An archive is listed against an
allowed set before it ships, for the same reason the bundle is: an ignore
file is a list of what to drop, and a secret is what nobody thought to list.

    python scripts/pack_extension.py                # dist/<platform>.invisible_playwright_mcp-extension.zip x3
