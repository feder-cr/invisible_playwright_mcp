# invisible_playwright_mcp Wiki

invisible_playwright_mcp is an open-source AI browser agent: a web browsing agent with a real browser. You say what you want in plain language, and it browses, clicks, types and reads the actual web to get it done. This wiki is the reading room
around it - what an AI web agent is, how the tools in this space compare,
what to do when an agent gets blocked, and how to put an agent to work.

The [README](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp#readme) is the fastest way to
run invisible_playwright_mcp. The pages here are for the questions that come before and after:
which tool fits, why something failed, and what is actually happening
underneath. Every page on this wiki is one link away from this one.

## The layer underneath

invisible_playwright_mcp drives a Firefox patched at the C++ level so the browser itself looks
and behaves like a normal desktop browser. That engine has its own
documentation, maintained with the same care as this wiki: the
[invisible_playwright wiki](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki)
covers browser fingerprinting, bot-detection vendors, network and proxy
mechanics, and the automation layer in depth. Pages here link into it wherever
the mechanism matters.
