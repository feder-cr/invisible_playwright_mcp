"""The Codex plugin is INSTALLED and asked what it delivers, by the real client.

Same reason as `test_the_plugin_really_installs.py`: the Claude Code plugin
1.0.0 validated against every document and delivered zero servers, and only
running the client said so. Measured by hand on 2026-09-21 with codex-cli
0.155.1 (through `npx -y @openai/codex@latest`, in a throwaway `CODEX_HOME`):
`plugin marketplace add <this checkout>` registers `oss-invisible`, `plugin add
invisible-playwright-mcp@oss-invisible` installs, `mcp list` shows
`invisible_playwright_mcp  uvx invisible-playwright-mcp  enabled`, the cache
carries `skills/setup`, and the listed version is `1.0.0` whatever the manifest
says - so the version is not asserted here.

That row was measured under the package's PREVIOUS name, and the two columns
are written here in today's spelling because they are two different names and
reading them as one is the mistake to avoid: the first is the mcpServers key,
which is the module, and the second is the command, which is the distribution.

It needs a `codex` on PATH, which a CI runner does not have and this machine
reaches only through npx, so it skips there and runs for anyone who has the
client installed. `CODEX_HOME` points at a temporary directory, so nothing
here touches the person's own marketplaces or plugins.
