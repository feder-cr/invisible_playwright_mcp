"""Every tool tells a client, before it is called, whether it only reads.

A client decides from the annotations whether a call needs the person's
confirmation: a tool marked read-only runs on its own, one marked destructive
asks first, and one that says neither is treated as the worst case by careful
clients and as the best case by careless ones. A directory review refuses a
server whose tools carry no title or no hint, and that is where this was first
asked of us (2026-09-13) - but the reason to keep it is the confirmation
prompt, which is decided by these flags and by nothing else.

Read from the server the way a client reads them, over `list_tools`, so what
is asserted is what goes out on the wire. No browser is started. The check is a
function over the tool list, and a second test feeds it known-bad tools: one
with no annotations, one with no title, one saying nothing about what it
does, and one saying both things at once.

    ⛔ `reads` used to hold eight names and five of them were a lie. A tool
    marked read-only promises it changes nothing; `browser_read_text`,
    `browser_snapshot`, `browser_read_html`, `browser_take_screenshot` and
    `browser_evaluate` all go through `ready()`, which STARTS a real Firefox
    when none is running, and can reopen the url a restored session was owed.
    A client that trusted the flag to run them unattended was being told it
    could spawn a browser for free.

    The honest third group is the one the MCP hints already have: not
    read-only, and explicitly NOT destructive. It means additive - this may
    bring something into being, it will not wreck anything. Nothing on the
    page is changed by any of the five.

    Why they are not simply made read-only by refusing to start, which would
    be the other way to make the flag true: the server's own INSTRUCTIONS
    promise the opposite, "There is nothing to list, start or choose before
    acting ... or browser_snapshot to see what it is already on". Lazy start
    is the contract, so the declaration moves, not the behaviour. Whether
    that contract is the right one is a product question, recorded as such.

    `browser_watch` and `browser_list` stay read-only because they really are:
    they go through the peeking path and refuse instead of opening anything.
