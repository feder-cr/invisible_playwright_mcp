"""The declared floor is not below a version this package's behaviour needs.

⛔ A FLOOR IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES A FIX IN A DEPENDENCY REACH ANYBODY.
`invisible-playwright` is declared with `>=`, so a person who already has an
older wheel installed updates this package and keeps whatever that wheel does.
For a defect in the driver that is not a detail: up to 0.22.0 a click was not
delivered once - the hit target was read again AFTER the event and what it
found was turned into a retry, so any control that stops being hittable by its
own effect got pressed again. Measured on that version: a button that hides
itself took 1068 clicks across 30 calls, and every call then reported failure.

The floor was raised to 0.22.1 for that. This test exists so the next person to
touch the dependency line cannot lower it back without noticing, and so the
reason is carried by something that runs rather than by a comment nobody reads.

⛔ AND IT READS THE DECLARATION, NOT WHAT IS INSTALLED. A test that asked the
interpreter which version is importable would pass on this machine, where the
wrapper is installed from a checkout, and say nothing at all about what a user
who runs `pip install invisible-playwright-mcp` will get - which is the only thing a floor
decides.
