# A browser MCP server in GitHub Copilot

Copilot's agent mode can call MCP tools, which means it can drive a browser if
you give it one. The setup is short. What is worth reading is the part after
the setup, because an editor is a different environment from a chat client and
two of the defaults that are fine elsewhere are wrong here.

## The setup

Copilot reads MCP servers from a workspace file, `.vscode/mcp.json`, or from
your user settings if you want it in every project. The block is the same shape
every client uses: a command and its arguments.

For Microsoft's server:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

For this project's server the block is in
[the MCP server](mcp-server.md), which also lists the settings and every tool
with what it returns.

Then switch Copilot Chat to **agent mode**. Ask mode does not call tools, and
this is the single most common reason people conclude the server is not working
when it is registered correctly.

## Why `--isolated` matters more in an editor

The example above passes `--isolated` on purpose. In an editor you are very
likely to be the person who also has an MCP browser registered in a terminal
assistant, and two clients on one persistent profile produce
[browser is already in use](playwright-mcp-browser-already-in-use.md). An editor
is exactly where that collision shows up, because an editor is where people run
two assistants at once without noticing.

If you need to be logged in, prefer `--storage-state` over a shared persistent
profile, for the same reason.

## The tool budget, which nobody warns about

A browser server adds twenty-odd tool descriptions to the model's context on
every turn, and in an editor you probably already have several servers
registered. Copilot has a ceiling on how many tools it will offer at once, and
crossing it means some of them stop being available without a message that says
so.

The size of one browser server, measured on ours on 2026-10-11: **17 tools,
9,081 characters of description, 3,506 tokens per turn** once each tool's
argument schema is counted with it. Register two browser servers
in an editor that already has a file server and a search server and you are
spending a meaningful slice of the context window on tool descriptions before
your question arrives.

Two habits keep this from biting, and
[MCP servers for Claude Code](best-mcp-servers-for-claude-code.md) applies the
same budget to the other assistant most people have open:

**Enable capabilities you use, not all of them.** `--caps` is additive on
Microsoft's server. Vision, pdf and devtools off unless a page forces it.

**Do not register two browser servers.** Overlapping tool names double the
context and make the model's choice worse. Pick one.

## What changes about how you prompt

In an editor the model has your repository in context, which is powerful and
also the source of the main failure mode: it will happily read the code and
guess what the page must look like rather than opening it.

- **Say "open the page" explicitly** when you want it observed rather than
  inferred. "Check whether the login form submits" reads code. "Open
  localhost:3000, fill the login form and tell me what happens" uses the browser.
- **Give it a stopping condition.** Same as anywhere else, and worse here,
  because an editor session is long and nobody is watching token spend.
  [Playwright MCP best practices](playwright-mcp-best-practices.md) has the rest.
- **Point it at your dev server, not production.** Obvious, routinely ignored,
  and the reason an agent once filled in a real form.

## When the browser is the wrong tool here

An editor already has the code. If the question is answerable from the source,
the browser is a slow way to answer it, and every browser step costs a round
trip. Reach for it when the question is about **what the running page does** -
a layout that breaks, a request that fires, a flow that only fails in a real
browser - and not when it is about what the code says.

And if what you want is a repeatable check rather than an answer today, write a
Playwright test instead and let the CLI run it.
[Playwright MCP vs the CLI](playwright-mcp-vs-cli.md) has the split.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Does Copilot support MCP?** Yes, in agent mode. Ask mode does not call tools.

**Where does the config go?** `.vscode/mcp.json` for one workspace, user
settings for all of them.

**Why does Copilot not use the browser tools?** Almost always: not in agent
mode, or the tool ceiling is hit because several servers are registered.

**Can I use this with a local dev server?** Yes, and it is the best use of it in
an editor.

**Does it work in Cursor, Cline, Windsurf?** Yes, with a different top-level key
in the config file. [The MCP server](mcp-server.md) lists which key each client
expects, including the one that is not JSON.

have and the advice does not depend on which you chose.*
