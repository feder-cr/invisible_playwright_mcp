# AI browser agent vs n8n, Zapier and Make

These are not really competitors. They sit at different layers of the same
stack. n8n, Zapier and Make connect systems that already speak an API and
fire on an event. A browser agent takes over where no connector exists and
a human would otherwise click through a page by hand. Often the right
answer uses both.

## The question that decides it: does a connector exist?

Ask this before cost or reliability. If both systems you are connecting
expose an API, and a platform already has, or can build, a connector for
them, that platform wins on every axis: speed to set up, cost per run,
nothing to babysit. A browser agent driving a page to do what an API call
could have done directly is slower, pricier per run, and adds a failure
mode that did not need to exist.

The gap opens once one side of the task has no API at all: an internal tool
nobody wrapped an endpoint around, a portal that only ships a web page, a
site built for a person rather than a program. An agent reads and clicks
that page the way a person would, because that is the only way in. [What an
AI browser agent actually is](ai-web-agent-explained.md) covers the
mechanism.

## Event triggers versus a task you launch

No-code platforms are built around triggers: a webhook fires, a row lands
in a spreadsheet, an email arrives, and the workflow runs unattended, at
whatever hour that happens. Reacting to events nobody is watching is the
model's real strength, and it is not a strength a browser agent shares in
the same way.

An agent, by contrast, is usually launched to do a task: find this, do
that, report back, once. It can sit behind a schedule too, but the
reasoning happens inside a single run, not across a queue of waiting
events. Do this every time that happens: start with the trigger-shaped
tool. Do this one thing, working out the steps as you go: start with the
agent.

## What a run actually costs, on each side

A no-code workflow's cost per execution is close to fixed: a handful of
API calls, billed by whatever run-count pricing the platform uses. No
figures appear on this page on purpose, because these tiers move and a
stale number here would be worse than none: read the pricing page of the
platform you are choosing on the day you choose it.

An agent's cost is different in shape. It pays for at least one model call
per decision, often several inside one run: read the page, decide, act,
check the result. A heavier page means more calls, and the page's own
content can cost more tokens than the instruction did. A workflow runs
close to a flat fee; an agent's bill moves with how complicated the page
turns out to be. Neither wins outright: it depends whether an API ever
reached the job at all.

## Reliability, retries, and who maintains the thing

A workflow calling an API breaks the way an API breaks: rarely, with a
documented error code a retry policy already handles. The connector is
maintained by the platform vendor, not you, so a schema change on the far
end is their problem to catch before it becomes yours.

An agent's task breaks the way a page breaks: a redesign moves a button, a
flow gains a step, the copy shifts just enough to fool a fixed script.
Reading and deciding, instead of following rigid selectors, is exactly
what lets an agent survive small layout drift a scripted flow would not.
[Traditional scraping vs an AI browser agent](ai-browser-agents-vs-traditional-scraping.md)
covers why. The catch: nobody but you maintains that page-reading
behavior, because there was never a connector for a vendor to patch.

## The pattern that actually works: call the agent from inside the workflow

The strongest setups do not make these tools compete. A common shape: an
n8n or Make workflow runs on its usual trigger, handles everything with an
API cleanly, then hits the one step with no connector, a portal, an
internal system, a manual lookup, by calling out to a browser agent for
just that step. The workflow resumes with whatever the agent hands back.

That keeps the fixed-cost, reliable part on the platform built for it, and
spends the agent's more expensive reasoning only where a connector
genuinely does not exist. In practice that call-out is usually an HTTP
request to whatever endpoint fronts the agent, or an MCP client talking to
a server the agent exposes; invisible_playwright_mcp runs through
`uvx invisible-playwright-mcp` for exactly this kind of hookup. n8n's own
documentation describes the generic route in one line: the HTTP Request
node "allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or
service with a REST API", and calls it one of the most versatile nodes
they ship. That is the node the agent hangs off.

## One sentence on where we stand

This wiki maintains [invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp), a
browser agent, so take the case for the no-connector path above with that
in mind.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**Can Zapier or Make control a web browser directly?** Not the way an
agent does. Both can run a fixed sequence of browser steps in some
integrations, but you write that sequence in advance; nothing decides the
next move on the fly.

**Is an AI browser agent cheaper than n8n?** Wrong comparison. n8n's cost
per run stays close to flat; an agent's cost shifts with page complexity
and how many model calls the task needs.

**Can I trigger a browser agent from a Zapier or Make webhook?** Yes, if
the agent is reachable over HTTP. Every one of these platforms has a
generic outbound request step for services they have no dedicated
connector for, which is exactly the case an agent falls into. The node
name differs per platform, so check the current one in their docs.

**Do I need to code to use n8n instead of an AI agent?** No. n8n, Zapier
and Make connect existing apps without code. An agent still needs a
plain-language instruction, a lower bar than code, but not zero setup.

**When does a browser agent replace a no-code workflow entirely?** When
neither side of the task has an API to reach at all: an internal system, a
portal, a page built only for humans.
