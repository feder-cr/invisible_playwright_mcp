"""The two listings this package publishes to describe the version that ships.

Two files in this repository are read by somebody else's machine, not by ours:

  1. `server.json` at the root is what `mcp-publisher` sends to the Official
     MCP Registry, and the registry checks the PyPI package it names for a
     `mcp-name: <server name>` token in the published description, which is
     README.md. A version in server.json that is not the version on the index
     is refused by the registry; a missing token is refused too, with
     "Registry validation failed for package".
  2. `manifest.json` at the root makes the repository itself the MCP bundle
     (MCPB manifest 0.4, server.type "uv"): `scripts/pack_bundle.py` zips
     the tracked tree minus `.mcpbignore`, and a host runs the server from
     the archive with `uv run --directory <bundle> python -m invisible_playwright_mcp`, which
     installs the package from the bundle's own `pyproject.toml`. Until
     2026-09-13 the bundle was a separate `mcpb/` folder whose pyproject
     pinned the published package - a pointer to PyPI, spec-valid but not
     the layout the spec describes, and `type: python` with nothing bundled,
     which the spec forbids. Now the manifest carries a copy of the version
     and the archive carries the source.

That is three copies of one number (pyproject, server.json, the manifest)
and one token that must match a name. Each pair was written by hand on
2026-09-12 and they agreed; nothing made them agree. The registry job in
publish.yml runs on the tag, which is after the bump, and would only find out
at the end of a release. This test finds out on the pull request.

  3. Since 2026-09-13, five manifests at the root are read by plugin loaders
     and directory crawlers: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the Claude Code
     plugin), `.mcp.json` (the only file Claude Code actually reads the server
     from - see MCP_FILES), `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` (the Agent Plugins
     standard, which cursor.directory scans for) and `gemini-extension.json`
     (the Gemini CLI gallery, which crawls the `gemini-cli-extension` topic).
     None of them carries the package version - a manifest that just says `uvx
     invisible_playwright_mcp` does not change per release - but every one of them repeats the
     package name, the one-line description and the launch command, and the
     bundle manifest repeats the description too. Those are the copies this
     file makes agree.

     ⛔ THIS PARAGRAPH SAID SOMETHING ELSE UNTIL 2026-09-13 EVENING, AND IT
     CONTRADICTED THE CODE TEN LINES BELOW IT. It named `.cursor-plugin/
     plugin.json`, removed in #1316, and said the Claude manifest "points at
     `mcp.json`", which is the arrangement that shipped a plugin with no
     tools. `PLUGIN_FILES` had been right the whole time. A docstring that
     disagrees with the constant under it is how the next reader learns the
     wrong thing from the file that exists to teach the right one.

Every check is a function over strings and dicts, and a second test feeds them
known-bad input: a check that has only ever said "consistent" is not a check.

#: No `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` since 2026-09-13 night: Cursor's own docs say
#: "A plugin that follows the Agent Plugins specification loads in Cursor
#: without changes", and that manifest is their format for rules, agents,
#: commands and hooks, none of which this plugin has. cursor.directory's scan
#: read `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` and never the logo that file carried.
PLUGIN_FILES = (".claude-plugin/plugin.json", "plugin.json", "mcp.json", ".mcp.json",
                "gemini-extension.json", ".codex-plugin/plugin.json")
#: The Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) reads its server through
#: the `mcpServers` POINTER at `./.mcp.json` and its skills through `skills`:
#: measured 2026-09-21 with codex-cli 0.155.1 from a local marketplace,
#: `codex mcp list` shows `invisible_playwright_mcp  uvx invisible-playwright-mcp  enabled`. The opposite of
#: Claude Code, which ignores the pointer and reads the file by position; one
#: `.mcp.json`, two loaders, each told in the way it listens.
CODEX_PLUGIN = ".codex-plugin/plugin.json"
CODEX_MARKETPLACE = ".agents/plugins/marketplace.json"
#: The setup skill Anthropic's submission guide recommends for a plugin whose
#: MCP server needs a one-time step ("Plugins can include a SETUP.md skill to
#: guide Claude through configuring and connecting any MCP servers bundled in
#: the plugin"). Ours is the engine download, and a plugin installed from the
#: directory never shows the README where that block lives. The block itself
#: is held identical to the README's by scripts/check_content.py, which scans
#: skills/ like a wiki page.
SETUP_SKILL = "skills/setup/SKILL.md"
#: ⛔ TWO NAMES FOR ONE CONFIGURATION, AND NEITHER IS OPTIONAL. Measured
#: 2026-09-13 by installing the plugin in this machine's Claude Code from a
#: local marketplace: with `mcp.json` and `"mcpServers": "./mcp.json"` in the
#: manifest, `claude plugin details invisible_playwright_mcp` reports **MCP servers (0)** - the
#: plugin installs, validates, and delivers no tools at all. So does the
#: inline form. Only a file named `.mcp.json` at the plugin root is read, with
#: or without the manifest field, and it is read even carrying the Agent
#: Plugins `$schema` and `type` keys. Meanwhile the Agent Plugins spec (§7.2.1)
#: says the MCP configuration path is `mcp.json` and MUST NOT be loaded from an
#: alternative path, which is what cursor.directory scans for.
#:
#: Hence both names, byte-identical, held equal here. `claude plugin validate`
#: passed on the broken arrangement: a manifest that validates is not a
#: manifest that works, and only running the thing said so.
MCP_FILES = ("mcp.json", ".mcp.json")

#: The marketplace this repository IS, so `claude plugin marketplace add
#: oss-invisible/playwright_mcp` needs no catalog kept by anybody else: one entry, whose
#: source is the repository root, because the plugin is the repository. Held
#: here because it repeats the package name, the description and the author,
#: and because the README's install line names `<plugin>@<marketplace>`: the
#: marketplace's name is declared in that file and nowhere else, and the
#: README is held to it, so a rename there is a red README until the line a
#: reader copies follows. (The wiki is held to the README's line in turn, by
#: scripts/check_content.py.)

    ⛔ AN AUDIT ON 2026-09-13 COUNTED 24 DUPLICATED FACTS AND FOUND 9 WITH
    NOTHING HOLDING THEM TOGETHER: the licence in four files, the author in
    three, the keyword list in three, the repository url in four, the display
    title in three, and the registry's own description. Each is a hand-copy,
    each is invisible when it drifts, and a directory shows whichever copy it

    already held; these are the rest.

    Two differences are DELIBERATE and are asserted as differences, not
    smoothed away, because an unexplained difference is how the next reader
    decides one of them is a bug:

    * `homepage`. The bundle manifest has `homepage`, `documentation` and
      `support` as separate fields, so its homepage is the repository and its
      documentation is the wiki. A plugin manifest has only `homepage`, so it
      points at the wiki page for this server, which is the more useful of the
      two for somebody who just installed a plugin. Same fact, different field
      sets, and each file uses the most specific field it has.
    * the PyPI summary in `pyproject.toml`. It addresses somebody choosing a
      command to install, not somebody browsing a directory of MCP servers,
      and it is tuned for that. It is not a copy of the directory description
      and is not asserted to be one.

    to one is a change to both or it is a red test.

    ⛔ MEASURED, SO THE TWIN IS NOT A GUESS. Claude Code 2.1.258, four plugins
    with distinct names in one marketplace so no cache entry could collide,
    each installed into a throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: `.mcp.json` alone
    delivers the server, the manifest pointer delivers none, the inline form
    delivers none, and BOTH FILES TOGETHER - what we ship - delivers one. The
    documentation describes all three forms; two of them do not work. So the
    duplication is imposed on us, not chosen, and the twin is proven harmless.

    ⛔ AND `.mcp.json` CARRYING THE AGENT PLUGINS `$schema` IS DELIBERATE.
    Claude Code asks for no `$schema` and ignores fields it does not know,
    which the measurement above confirms. Dropping it from that copy would buy
    a tidier file and cost the strongest property this pair has: that the two
    are the same bytes, which is what makes drift between them impossible to
    miss. A field a loader ignores is a smaller price than a second content to
