# Playwright MCP with a proxy

Microsoft's server takes `--proxy-server`, the same shape Chromium has always
used, plus `--proxy-bypass` for hosts that should go direct. That is the
configuration part and it is one line. The rest of this page is the part that
decides whether it helps.

## Why the proxy is often the real fix

When an agent starts failing on a site that worked from your laptop, the change
is usually not the browser. It is where the request came from. A laptop on a
domestic connection and a container on a cloud host present two very different
network identities, and the second one is pre-judged before a single byte of
your page interaction happens.

That is worth knowing before you spend a day switching servers.
[Why an agent gets blocked](why-does-my-ai-agent-get-blocked.md) works through
attributing the failure properly, and the network is the first place to look,
not the last.

## The three leaks a proxy does not close by itself

Routing HTTP through a proxy is not the same as being at the other end of it.
Three specific things stay behind unless you handle them.

**DNS.** If names are resolved locally and only the connection is proxied, the
resolution path still points home. It is invisible in a browser and obvious to
anything watching resolvers. Whether it leaks depends on the proxy scheme: a
SOCKS5 proxy can be told to resolve remotely, an HTTP proxy resolves for you by
design, and a local resolver in front of either undoes both.

**WebRTC.** The classic one. A page can ask the browser to enumerate candidate
addresses, and unless the browser is configured otherwise it will happily report
the machine's real ones. The engine wiki has the mechanism and the test:
[WebRTC leaks with a proxy](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/webrtc-leak-proxy).

**Timezone and locale.** The one people forget, and the one that is trivially
checkable from JavaScript. If the exit says Frankfurt and
`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` says your own city, that is a
contradiction no amount of proxying fixes. Set it to match the exit, or accept
that you are self-reporting a mismatch.

None of these is exotic. All three are readable in a few lines from a page, and
the engine wiki documents
[how to check whether a proxy leaks your real IP](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright/wiki/how-to-check-proxy-ip-leak)
so you can test rather than assume.

## Choosing what to route through

**Do not proxy everything reflexively.** A proxied session is slower, and if the
proxy is shared its reputation is not yours to control: you can move from a
neutral address to one that a hundred other people have already spent. For
sites that were never a problem, the direct path is fine, which is what
`--proxy-bypass` exists for.

**Residential and datacenter are different products.** A datacenter address is
fast, stable and identifiable as a datacenter. A residential one is neither fast
nor stable and is not pre-judged the same way. Which you want depends on whether
the site is judging the address at all, and that is testable.

**Rotation is not free.** An address that changes mid-session is a session that
looks like it moved city between two clicks. If you rotate, rotate between
sessions, not inside one.

## In this project

[invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/oss-invisible/playwright_mcp)'s server takes the proxy in two
places rather than one. `STEALTHFOX_PROXY` in the config block that registers
the server is the default exit for everything it opens. `browser_open` also
takes a `proxy` argument, so the exit is changeable mid-conversation without
touching the config, and the helper browser can leave by a different address
than the main one - or, given no proxy of its own, by the same one.

What that buys is the third leak above, closed by construction rather than by
remembering: with a proxy set, the timezone and locale are derived from the exit
instead of from the host, so the contradiction this page warns about cannot be
introduced by forgetting. `STEALTHFOX_NO_PROXY` goes out from the machine's own
address when you want that deliberately, and passing `""` for `proxy` insists on
no proxy for one browser even when the environment sets one.

It is a different shape, not a better one: deriving the timezone costs you the
ability to proxy while keeping your own clock, which is occasionally what
someone wants. [The MCP server](mcp-server.md) has the full settings table.

## Short answers to the questions that lead here

**How do I set a proxy in Playwright MCP?** `--proxy-server` on the server
command line, with `--proxy-bypass` for hosts that should go direct.

**Can I use a different proxy per browser?** Not with a single process and a
command-line flag. Either run one server per proxy, or use a server that takes
the proxy as a tool argument rather than only at startup.

**Does a proxy hide that I am automating?** No. It changes where the request
comes from. Everything a page can read about the browser is unchanged, and so is
your pacing.

**Will a proxy fix a challenge page?** Sometimes, when the address was the
reason. Often not.
[Cloudflare and Playwright MCP](cloudflare-and-playwright-mcp.md) covers what a
challenge is actually reading.

**Do I need a residential proxy?** Only if the site is judging the address type.
Test with the cheap option first; a lot of failures attributed to the address
are pacing.
