"""Content gates for this repository's published surface.

Checks over docs/, articles/, assets/ and the README, each born from a real
incident rather than a hypothetical. How many there are is deliberately not
written here: this file said "five" while running six, and a hand-written count
inside the file that exists to catch stale numbers is the joke telling itself.
Count the numbered entries.

  1. Banned-topic scan. Pages on retired topics must not come back; a stale
     branch once squash-merged five of them straight onto main. Historical
     one-line mentions are pinned in an explicit allowance table.
  2. Dash and invisible-Unicode scan. No em/en dashes, and none of the
     invisible or formatting codepoints that text pipelines can smuggle in
     (zero-width, bidi controls, variation selectors, tag block).
  3. CLI-surface scan. Every `<command> <subcommand>` a page teaches must exist
     in src/invisible_playwright_mcp/cli.py. A release once removed a subcommand while 13 wiki
     pages still taught it.
  4. Internal links. Every `](page.md)` in docs/ must point at a page that
     exists, and image assets must carry no metadata chunks.
  5. The way in is written once. The README's code blocks are the source:
     in every fence that installs uv (one per system), the run from the
     installer line to the end of the fence, PATH line included, minus the
     line that runs the product (the interface fence ends with it); the
     first fenced line that runs the command names the launcher in front of
     every command (`uvx` today; until 0.69.0 the fetch line did, and the
     fetch line left the README when the server began downloading the engine
     itself); and the lines that tell a client the server exists, one per client
     (`claude plugin install invisible-playwright-mcp@oss-invisible`, `gemini extensions install
     ...`, `codex mcp add ...`). A page that carries the uv installer carries
     the install lines verbatim, every code block runs the command (the server,
     or `invisible-playwright-mcp ui`) and the fetch with the README's launcher, a page that
     tells a client the server exists says it with the README's line or names
     the route bare, and no page teaches a way in that the README does not
     (`pip install invisible-playwright-mcp`; `claude mcp add`, once the README moved to the
     plugin). On 2026-09-06 the route went uv, pip, uv in one day, and each
     flip touched the README plus twenty-odd wiki pages by hand; on
     2026-09-21 Claude Code moved from `claude mcp add` to the plugin and
     Gemini CLI from `gemini mcp add` to the extension, and five pages went
     on teaching the old lines with this check green, because it read only
     the installer lines.
  6. MCP-tool scan. Every `browser_*` or `session_*` tool a page teaches must
     be declared in the server. 0.39.0 and 0.41.0 between them removed nine
     tools, and four published pages went on teaching them - one told the
     reader to set the proxy at a tool that no longer exists.
  7. Tool-surface size. A page that publishes how big this server's tool
     surface is must publish the live figure. On 2026-09-13 eleven pages
     quoted a character count that was stale AND had been measured the wrong
     way, and nothing could go red about it: a number copied into prose has
     no link back to what it measured. This check is that link.

Run: python scripts/check_content.py            (from the repo root)
     python scripts/check_content.py --selftest (prove the gate on known-bad)

#: ⛔ A PUBLISHED NUMBER GOES STALE AND NOTHING SAYS SO, which is the failure
#: this whole check exists for. On 2026-09-13 eleven live pages quoted "8,639
#: characters" and "16 tools" for this server's tool surface. Both had to be
#: corrected by hand, and the only reason anybody looked was that a new page
#: needed the figure. Two independent errors were sitting there: the count was
#: stale (a release had lengthened descriptions), and it had been measured the
#: natural wrong way, by summing docstrings while what the protocol sends is a
#: name, a description AND a JSON schema per tool.
#:
#: The pattern is worth naming because the project keeps meeting it: a measured
#: number copied into prose has no link back to the thing it measured, so it
#: cannot go red. A gate is the link.
#:
#: What this checks: the TOOL COUNT and the TOTAL DESCRIPTION CHARACTERS, both
#: recomputed from the server's source with `ast` - no imports, no dependencies,
#: and verified on 2026-09-13 to agree with the running registry to the
#: character (16 tools, 9,145). A page may state them or not; if it states them,
#: they must be right.
#:
#: ⛔ What it does NOT see, said plainly so nobody trusts it wider than it is:
#: the TOKEN figure. Counting tokens needs a tokenizer this gate does not have
#: and should not grow a dependency for. The token count rides in the same
#: sentences as the character count, so a stale one is caught by its neighbour.
#:
#: ⛔ THAT USED TO READ "very likely caught", AND THE HEDGE WAS MEASURABLE.
#: Measured 2026-09-15, while moving the figure for real: of the fourteen pages
#: publishing the token count, TWO published it with no character count beside
#: it, so on those two the neighbour protected nothing and a stale number would
#: have shipped. The two were given the character figure they were missing, and

    switched off - the failure this file already records once.

    A tool count appears in prose for a dozen honest reasons. "N characters of
    description" appears for exactly one: describing THIS server, because
    nobody publishes a competitor's docstring byte count. So the character
    figure decides whether a paragraph is making the claim at all, and the
    tool count is verified only where it sits beside one. Nothing is lost by
    the narrowing: adding or removing a tool moves the character total too, so
    the anchor sees every change the tool count would have seen.
