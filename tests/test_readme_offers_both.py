"""The README offers BOTH ways in, and offers them first.

⛔ THE REQUIREMENT IS ABOUT POSITION, NOT PRESENCE, which is why this file exists
instead of a grep. There are two ways to use this product and only one real
question behind them - where the model comes from:

  1. you already have an MCP client with a model in it (Claude Code, Claude
     Desktop, Cursor), and this browser arrives there as tools;
  2. you have no client, and our interface brings a model with an OpenRouter key.

Both were already documented before this test was written. The MCP server named
the interface at line 140 of 161, under a heading that reads like a footnote, and
the interface named the MCP path at line 114 of 159 under "Already have an MCP
client? Then you may not need this at all". A reader who stopped at the first
screen - which is most readers - saw one option and concluded it was the only one.

So the assertion is that the offer sits in the FIRST section that is not the
title, and that both commands are inside it. A README that mentions both paths
somewhere passes a grep and fails the requirement.

#: installs the server AND the setup skill, and which Claude Code counts as
#: an installation of this plugin where a hand-registered server is counted
#: by nobody. The UI way stays bare, without the `uvx `, so the test measures
